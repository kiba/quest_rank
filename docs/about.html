Just what is a quest anyway?

A quest is both a story and a game, in which the readers or the players determine the action of a single character or entity through the act of discussion and voting.

Once the voting is done, the author, known as the questmaster, begin writing the next chapter.

What are the rules of quests?

The rules can be anywhere to elaborate to extremely simple, may or may involve dice rollings, may use a pre-designed RPG system or a homebrewed one.
