Just what is a quest anyway?

A quest is both a story and a game, in which the readers or the players determine the action of a single character or entity through the act of discussion and voting.

What are the rules of quests?

The rules can be anywhere to elaborate to extremely simple, may or may involve dice rollings, may use a pre-designed RPG system or a homebrewed one.
